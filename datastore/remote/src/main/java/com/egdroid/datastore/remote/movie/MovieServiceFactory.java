     /*OkHttp interceptors work as a chain, hence the name chain for the class you receive in the
  interceptor method. The interceptors are run in order of addition for requests and in reverse-order
  of addition for responses. For example, if you add first the logging interceptor and then the
  authentication one, you'll be running first the logging one for requests and then the authentication one.
  This means you won't see the authentication headers of the request
  (or any other authentication field for that matter) logged because they're added after you've logged the request.
   By contrast, if you add the logging interceptor at the end, you'll see everything that was added by
   the previous interceptors.
   ---> In the end, you're not running the request multiple times if you call chain.proceed(chain.request),
   you're simply passing it along the chain and waiting for the response.
